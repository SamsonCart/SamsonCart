## 🚀 About Me

I’m a multi-disciplinary technologist and builder with a background in software engineering, risk analysis, and operations. After years in high-pressure culinary leadership roles (Disney, Chick-fil-A), I transitioned into tech to solve complex problems that impact real lives—from national cybersecurity tools to inclusive web applications.

My passion lies in **mission-driven work** that blends people, process, and code. Whether it’s leading Agile teams, analyzing CVE data for the U.S. Navy, or co-creating apps for underserved communities, I focus on systems that are **secure, resilient, and human-centered**.
